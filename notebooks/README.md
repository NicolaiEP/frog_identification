This folder of notebooks only has the purpose of working as a reference to some of the earlier reworkings that we have done. The notebooks are gotten from https://github.com/uiaict/frog_identity_recognition/tree/master/frog_identity_recognition and are modified.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Running them here as they are, will probably not work, since they are taken out of their original working directory. They will fail to import the necessary files because of that.
