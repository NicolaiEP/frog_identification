# frog_identification

This is just a small collection of notebooks that were used in experimentation in a short project with the goal of identifying northern pool frog (Pelophylax
lessonae) from their stomach pattern.

Do not expect the notebooks to work the way they are now in the repository. Among other things, they are missing the data folders for this project.
